      About Me
    </h1>
    <img src="../assets/images/Major.jpg" alt="Image of me" height="250">
    <p>My name is Irabor Osadolor Osas, the founder of Majortech Electrical and Electronics Services. 
      I've actually been a tech enthusiast from when i began understanding the world. So i joined the science department
      when i was in High school and began the quest to satisfy my thirst for knowledge. As i would have it, i gained addmision
      into college to study industrial Physics which of course opened my mind to accomodate scientific knowledge.
      I hope to become a professional Full Stack DeVops so as to make life easy for me and my immediate environment and the world at large.
      Like i would always say: The mind of any Human cannot be underrated. It is capable of achieving anything it set its heart to
      do. Thank you.

      Truth of the matter is, i'd always enrolled in a Tech course, however, during the course of the journey certain challenges 
      would divert my attention and i lose focus. Nevertheless, this time it's a promise to myself never to fail myself in achieving 
      the goal of being amongst the Top 10 Tech gurus in Nigeria. I know with hardwork coupled with smartwork i can do it.
      So please, if you are reading this, i trust your support via any positive means will go a long way. Thank You.
